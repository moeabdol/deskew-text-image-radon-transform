# Deskew Images with Text Using Radon Transform
Automatically detect rotation and line spacing of an image of text using Radon
transform.

If the image is rotated by the inverse of the output, the lines will be
horizontal (though they may be upside-down depending on the original image).

**Note: It doesn't work with black borders.**
